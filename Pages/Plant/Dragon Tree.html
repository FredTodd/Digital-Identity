	<p>Dragon tree is a common name for several species of plants belonging to the genus Dracaena, which are native to Africa and the Canary Islands. These plants are known for their striking, tropical appearance and are popular as houseplants due to their ease of care.

Dragon trees have long, slender stems that can reach up to 10 feet (3 meters) tall in their natural habitat, but they can be grown as smaller indoor plants. The leaves of the plant are long, narrow, and usually green, although some species have variegated or colored leaves.

One of the most popular species of dragon tree is Dracaena marginata, also known as the Madagascar dragon tree. This plant has thin, spiky leaves that are green with a reddish edge. Another popular species is Dracaena fragrans, which has broader leaves that are often variegated.

Dragon trees are easy to care for and can tolerate a wide range of growing conditions, from low to bright, indirect light. They prefer well-draining soil and should be watered when the top inch (2.5 cm) of soil is dry to the touch. They are also known for their air-purifying properties, as they can help remove harmful toxins from the air.

One of the unique features of dragon trees is their ability to grow aerial roots, which can give them a distinctive appearance. These roots are not used for nutrient uptake like typical roots, but rather help to stabilize the plant in its natural environment.

Overall, dragon trees are a popular choice for indoor gardening due to their striking appearance, ease of care, and air-purifying properties.</p>
