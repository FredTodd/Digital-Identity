	<p>Dracaena fragrans, commonly known as the corn plant, is a popular indoor plant that belongs to the Asparagaceae family. It is native to tropical Africa, from Sudan to Mozambique, and is known for its attractive foliage and ease of care.

The corn plant has long, narrow leaves that are dark green with a yellow or white stripe running down the middle. As the plant ages, the leaves may become more solid green. The plant also produces fragrant white flowers in clusters, although they are relatively rare in indoor settings.

One of the benefits of the corn plant is that it is a low-maintenance plant that can thrive in a variety of lighting conditions, from low light to bright, indirect light. It prefers well-draining soil and should be watered when the top inch (2.5 cm) of soil is dry to the touch. It is important not to overwater the plant, as this can lead to root rot.

Corn plants can grow up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall, but can be pruned to maintain a smaller size. They are also known for their air-purifying properties, as they can help remove harmful toxins from the air, making them a popular choice for indoor spaces.</p>
