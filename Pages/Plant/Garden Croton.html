	<p>The Garden Croton, also known as Codiaeum variegatum, is a tropical evergreen shrub that is native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is grown for its strikingly colorful and variegated foliage.

Garden Croton plants have large, glossy leaves that are green, yellow, red, orange, and sometimes purple, depending on the cultivar. The leaves are usually oblong or lance-shaped and can have wavy edges. The plant can grow up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall and wide, but is often pruned to a smaller size.

Garden Croton is a popular ornamental plant for indoor or outdoor gardens, but it requires careful attention to its growing conditions. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil that is kept moist but not waterlogged. The plant is sensitive to cold temperatures and should be protected from frost.

Garden Croton can be propagated from stem cuttings, but it is important to wear gloves when handling the plant, as its sap can cause skin irritation. Ingesting the plant can also be toxic to pets and humans, so it should be kept out of reach of children and animals.

Despite its high maintenance requirements, Garden Croton is a popular choice for gardeners who want to add a burst of color to their indoor or outdoor spaces. Its unique and vibrant foliage can create a tropical feel in any environment.</p>
