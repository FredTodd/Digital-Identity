	<p>Fishbone cactus, also known as Epiphyllum anguliger, is a unique and beautiful cactus species that is native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is known for its long, flat, and uniquely shaped stems that resemble fishbones, hence its common name.

The stems of the fishbone cactus can grow up to 3 feet (90 cm) long and are made up of flat segments with slightly serrated edges. The stems are usually green but can turn purplish-red under stress or in response to changes in light conditions.

Fishbone cactus blooms with showy, white or pale pink flowers that open at night and close during the day. The flowers are large, funnel-shaped, and can reach up to 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter.

Fishbone cactus is an epiphytic plant, which means it naturally grows on other plants or objects in its native habitat. As a result, it prefers a well-draining potting mix and should be watered only when the soil is dry to the touch. It also prefers bright, indirect light but can tolerate some direct sunlight.

Fishbone cactus is an easy-to-care-for plant that is perfect for beginners, as it is relatively low maintenance and can be grown indoors or outdoors in warm climates. It is also a popular choice for hanging baskets or as a trailing plant in a pot or planter.

Overall, fishbone cactus is a unique and beautiful plant that is sure to add a touch of tropical charm to any home or garden. Its unusual shape and stunning flowers make it a standout choice for any succulent or cactus collection.</p>
