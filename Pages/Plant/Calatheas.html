	<p>Calatheas are a group of tropical plants that are known for their attractive foliage and vibrant colors. They belong to the Marantaceae family and are native to the rainforests of Central and South America.

Calatheas have large, broad leaves that are often variegated or patterned with stripes or spots in various shades of green, red, pink, and purple. The undersides of the leaves are often a different color than the tops, which gives them an interesting two-tone effect.

One of the unique features of Calatheas is that their leaves move throughout the day in response to changes in light. They open their leaves up during the day to absorb as much light as possible, and then close them up at night to conserve moisture.

Calatheas are popular as houseplants because they are relatively easy to care for and add a tropical feel to any indoor space. They prefer bright, indirect light and well-draining soil that is kept moist but not waterlogged. They also benefit from high humidity, so placing them on a pebble tray or using a humidifier can help keep them healthy.</p>
