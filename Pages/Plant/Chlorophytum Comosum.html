	<p>Chlorophytum comosum, commonly known as Spider Plant or Airplane Plant, is a popular and easy-to-grow houseplant that is native to southern Africa. It is known for its long, arching leaves that can reach up to 3 feet (90 cm) in length, and small plantlets that grow at the end of its long stems.

Spider plants are known for their air-purifying qualities, as they are effective at removing formaldehyde and other toxins from the air. They are also easy to care for and can tolerate a range of growing conditions, making them a popular choice for novice gardeners.

Spider plants prefer bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. They should be watered regularly, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. They are also relatively tolerant of low humidity and can be grown in a wide range of temperatures.

One of the unique features of spider plants is their ability to produce plantlets, or "spiderettes," that can be easily propagated. These plantlets can be snipped off and placed in soil to grow into new plants. This makes spider plants a great choice for those who want to share their plants with friends or expand their collection.

Spider plants are also safe for pets, making them a popular choice for pet owners who want to bring some greenery into their homes without putting their pets at risk. Overall, spider plants are a great choice for those who want a low-maintenance, attractive, and air-purifying houseplant.</p>
